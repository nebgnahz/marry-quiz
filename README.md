# Project Reuse Guide

```shell
## Install dependencies in your project directory with:
$ npm install

## For development
$ npm start

## For production build
$ npm run build
```

By default, development uses [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) as
the URL.

In production, you need to modify `package.json` to set the homepage. It will
build the app to the `build` folder. Production mode optimizes the build for the
best performance: such as minified file and the filenames include the
hashes. This is highly recommended.
